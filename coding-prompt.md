make me a program that displays a rotating image of the earth rendered in ascii characters. create the program in ./ascii-globe/ so that its file or files don't pollute the rest of the repo. The image of the earth should be reasonably detailed so that you can make out continents and it should rotate once every 5 seconds. To liven things up add stars, commets, and any other random space themed stuff for the background but keep it subtle so the main focus is the rotating globe. Include a banner across the top that reads "Hello World!" and a banner across the bottom that reads "Built with Coder!". the program should be executable from the terminal. If a globe.py already exists under ascii-globe/, then read it to understand how it works and complete the program.
